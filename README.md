# Blogger

Hey there. It's a blogger website which I designed some days ago using HTML, CSS and JavaScript(jquery and bit of vanilla). I think it will help you out building a website like mines. And of course it's a fully responsive website so no matter which viewporth deviece you're using it's gonna suppot. So, if you have any thing to understand about this website, in case you don't really know some codes of this website then you can always knock me out.
